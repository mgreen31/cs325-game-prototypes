<h2>Keep Cold!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Unlike other games, where the goal is to avoiding enemies entirely, this game is about avoiding an enemies ability to push you into hazardous situations.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This prototype has implemented a basic AI for the enemy that has it follow and push the player towards the flames.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This prototype, has taught its developer the basics of Phaser, and gave them a better understanding of how long a Phaser prototype can take to develop as a beginner.
The easiest parts were the abstract ideas of the prototype and knowing what mechanics could be doable in Phaser. 
The hardest part was trying to figure out how realize those ideas with Phaser in a unique manner. Being new to Phaser, it was difficult to make things original with this prototype.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This prototype mostly resembles the examples on the gamemechanicexplorer page. The AI for the UFO, while functionally different, feels similar to these examples.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Survive as long as you can, and collect stars to earn points, while the enemy attempts to throw you to the flames!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This prototype used themes of spacial strategy and survival in this project.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
In this prototype, a simple dodge and run play style was applied, with an added twist of slippery terrains.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This protoype evaluates the game mechanic of enemies pushing the player into hazardous areas. Collecting stars as points is used as an incentive for players to take risks to earn more points.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
In this prototype, the player was meant to feel competition, as a prey, against their predator as they attempt to survive. A multiplayer feature
could enhance the competetive aspect, letting 2 or more players attempt to push each other into the flames.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players can move left and right, jump, and double jump. The real action comes in their strategy to avoid the flying enemy. They can sweep under it, jump over it, or attempt to ride it across the stage. The player interacts with the game using the arrow keys on their keyboard. Left and right to move, and up to jump. This prototype would eventually evolve to include different moves to utilize on larger stages. Those moves would include dashing, quickly dropping to the ground, and a way to swat the enemy back. The gameplay would alter as well, as a larger level would allow for more enemies to pursue the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The most effective strategy seems to be to jump onto the enemy and keep in the air as much as possible to avoid be pushed into the flames. With added abilities, an offensive approach my become more viable.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set in an icy world. The ground is slick with ice at all times and the air is frigid. Creatures slip and slide on the ice trying to survive. Players play as these creatures and do their best to avoid being cooked alive and eaten by flying creatures from above.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target demographic for this prototype would be mobile or casual gamers of all ages, but primarily mobile users, who would likely benefit from updated controls using touch/motion sensors.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play? - The game takes a minute or two to play, but could last longer depending on how skillful the player is, as the goal is to stay alive for as long as possible.
