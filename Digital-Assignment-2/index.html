<h2>Meet in the Middle</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game? Players had to work together to reach each other on the other side.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? NPCs interact with the players using changing dialogue and dropping items
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? Creating methods for updating dialogue is simple, yet tedious.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? The easiest part of this prototype was developing the item pickup/drop functions, the hardest part was checking for certain parameters when the player inputs an action.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
This game is most closesly related to the phaser examples on phaser.io for collision and physics. These tutorials were used to create those features/mechanics in this prototype.

</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game. Work with your friend, and the npc's to find a way to reach each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used. N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype. This game is a multiplayer point-and-click adventure game/level
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating? Point-and-click adventure mechanics, such as inventorys, interacting with characters/objects and using objects to reach a goal.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game? Players should feel relaxed and enjoy the story that unfolds. This experience would be enhanced with a larger world and improved writing.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
Players can run, jump, pickup items, throw items over a wall and interact with npcs. The controls for player 1 are on the left side of the keyboard(wasd and e) and player 2 controls are on the left(ijkl and o).
The interact buttons(e and o), are used to pickup, throw, and interact with npcs.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
Strategies that evolve from this game are repeatedly talking to npcs to gain more information.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
The ideas and story for this game are abstract. The player is meant to ask why they are in the world, and why they would want to reach the other player. The story can be whatever the player's imagination comes up with. These abstract ideas could be used later to evolve the art and design of the game as mechanics are improved.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach. This game is for those who love point-and-click adventure games of all kinds
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play? This game only consists of 1 level, so it only takes a few minutes to play.
